                            When I was younger I would play vidoe games for at least six hours a day. I slowly noticed a change in my eyesight mood and knew I had to make a change. I learned the longer I was looking at the screen I would suffer long term affects. I was addicted to video games and also needed glasses for the damage to my eyesight. Now I want to help educate and help others who are addicted to video games and help them with their addiction.

              The American Eye Association suggests that you get an eye exam once a year if you have any vision problems but if you dont have any vision problems such as blurred vision or strain in your eyes to get your eyes checked every 5 years.   
                <p> When you are playing video games the constant blue light has an effect on your eyesight, I would suggest buying blue light glasses from your local walmart, target, or online on amazon.</p>

                <p>Do you look at a screen for over 2 hours a day? This includes at work, on your phone, or a tablet not just a computer.

All of these symptoms are what one can experinece when looking at a screen for too long. It is estimated that more than 60% of Americans experience the symptoms of computer eye syndrome.  </p>
